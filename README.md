## Daily Births Forecasting 

Our project's main goal was to forecast daily births using Facebook's fbprophet forecasting model, a potent time series analysis tool. Precise birth predictions are essential for organizing healthcare.

## Objective 

 The main objective was to develop a dependable model that could forecast daily birth counts using past data. The project's goal was to shed light on probable birth rate highs and lows.

## Deployment

To deploy the Facebook Prophet Model we use the streamlit to deploy the model and to run the deployed model we used Python 3.9 version the steps to deploy are 
 

```bash
  C:\Users\lenovo\facebook model
  #Running the Streamlit app
  streamlit run eda.py
```
 Right after starting of streamlit need to upload a dataset to forecast the births
